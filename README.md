* **Cloudinary Account:** Sign up for a free account at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/) to get your cloud name, API key, and API secret.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate into the `backend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * Install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables. **Replace placeholders with your actual credentials.**
        ```env
        PORT=5000
        MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/chat-app?retryWrites=true&w=majority # Or your local MongoDB URI
        JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_jwt_secret_key_here
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
        ```
    * Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
        The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified PORT).

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate into the `frontend` directory (from the project root):
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend # If you're currently in the backend directory
        # Or if you're in the project root: cd frontend
        ```
    * Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the backend URL. Ensure it matches the backend port.
        ```env
        VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
        ```
    * Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).

You should now have the full MERN Stack Chat Application running locally!

## üìù Code Overview

The project is logically separated into `frontend` (React app) and `backend` (Node.js/Express app).

### Frontend Structure

* **`src/context/`**: Contains React Context providers for global state management.
    * `AutoContext.js`: Manages user authentication state, handles login/signup/logout, profile updates, and the main Socket.io connection for tracking online users. It also configures `axios` with the authentication token.
    * `ChatContext.js`: Manages chat-specific state, including messages, user lists, selected conversations, and unseen message counts. It handles fetching messages and subscribing/unsubscribing to real-time message events via Socket.io.
* **`src/pages/`**: Contains the main page components.
    * `LoginPages.jsx`: The entry point for user authentication, providing forms for both "Sign up" and "Login Now".
    * `HomePages.jsx`: The primary chat interface, orchestrating the `Sidebar` (user list), `ChartContainer` (active chat), and `RightSidebar` (user profile/details).
    * `ProfilePage.jsx`: Allows authenticated users to view and update their profile details (full name, bio, and profile picture).
* **`src/assets/`**: Likely contains static assets like `logo_big`, `arrow_icon`, `avatar_icon`, `logo_icon` used in the UI.

### Backend Structure

* **`server.js`**:
    * The main entry point for the Node.js server.
    * Initializes Express app and HTTP server.
    * Sets up the Socket.io server with CORS configuration.
    * Manages online users through `userSocketMap` and emits `get Online users` events.
    * Configures Express middleware for JSON parsing (`express.json`) and CORS.
    * Defines API routes for authentication (`/api/auth`) and messages (`/api/messages`).
    * Connects to MongoDB using `connectDB()`.
* **`models/`**: Defines Mongoose schemas for MongoDB collections.
    * `Message.js`: Schema for chat messages, including `senderId`, `receiverId`, `text`, `image`, and `seen` status.
    * `User.js`: Schema for user accounts, including `email`, `fullName`, `password`, `profilePic`, and `bio`.
* **`middleware/protectRoute.js`**:
    * An Express middleware function that verifies the JWT from incoming requests (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
    * If the token is valid, it attaches the authenticated user's details (`req.user`) to the request object, allowing subsequent route handlers to access user information.
    * Protects routes that require authentication.
* **`lib/cloudinary.js`**: Configures the Cloudinary SDK using environment variables for image upload and management.
* **`lib/db.js`**: Contains the `connectDB` function responsible for establishing a connection to the MongoDB database.
* **`lib/generateToken.js`**: A utility function to sign a new JSON Web Token for a given user ID.
* **`routes/`**: (Inferred, based on `server.js` usage) These directories would contain the route definitions for different parts of your API.
    * `userRoutes.js`: Handles user authentication (signup, login) and profile-related actions.
    * `messageRoutes.js`: Handles sending messages, retrieving chat history, and marking messages as seen.
